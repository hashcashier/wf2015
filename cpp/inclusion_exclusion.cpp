/*Generalizing the results of these examples gives the principle of inclusionâ€“exclusion. To find the cardinality of the union of n sets:
1. Include the cardinalities of the sets.
2. Exclude the cardinalities of the pairwise intersections.
3. Include the cardinalities of the triple-wise intersections.
4. Exclude the cardinalities of the quadruple-wise intersections.
5. Include the cardinalities of the quintuple-wise intersections.
6. Continue, until the cardinality of the n-tuple-wise intersection is included (if n is odd) or excluded (n even).*/
